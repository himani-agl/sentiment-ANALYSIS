34,less than above options,greater than 5000Rs.,1,1,5,5,5,Online shopping is a waste of time. It cannot have as great as a feel as compared to real live shopping. It can be very beneficial for us. It has lots of disadvantages. One of them being that it is much better and cost efficient. Also the return policy is worst. We can easily return products or replace them. That should not be the case. We must have to go through various lengthy procedures to return items
